# Quantum Forge — Audit & Remediation Report

Date: 2026-07
Scope: `quantum_forge/` (Flutter web app) + `quantum_forge/avogadro_plugin/`

This document records what was actually wrong in the repository, what was changed,
and how each change is verified. It is deliberately specific: every item below was
reproduced in the code before being fixed.

---

## Verified starting state

| Gate | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `flutter analyze` | 33 issues (2 errors' worth of dead wiring, 8 warnings) | **0 issues** |
| `flutter test` | 1 trivial widget test | **102 tests, all passing** |
| `flutter build web` | compiled, with dead code paths | compiles |

## 1. Deficiencies found

### 1.1 Settings system was dead code (highest impact)

* `AppSettingsNotifier` was **never instantiated** and never registered in the
  `MultiProvider` tree in `main.dart`. The analyzer flagged it as an unused import.
  Consequence: `isCompactMode`, `defaultExportFormat`, `autoSaveIntervalMinutes` and
  `showTooltips` had **no effect anywhere in the app**. There was also no settings
  screen at all — the only "settings" surface was a theme dropdown inside one
  `AlertDialog`.
* `AppSettingsNotifier` used `shared_preferences` while the compute settings used a
  bespoke `LocalPrefs`/`web_bindings.dart` path. Two persistence mechanisms, one of
  them unreachable.
* Several `QuantumSettingsNotifier` persistence keys were inconsistent: some used
  `static const _key…` fields (four of which were unused) and others used bare string
  literals (`'convergence'`, `'nmfConvergence'`, `'nmove'`, `'hfToken'`, …), so a
  typo in either place would silently lose a user's parameter.
* **Race condition (found by test, not by reading).** `updateSettings` fired
  `_save()` on every change without orderin g them. Five rapid toggles started five
  independent async writes; only the first future was tracked, so an older snapshot
  could land last and resurrect an outdated value. Reproduced deterministically in a
  test: after `setCompactMode → setDefaultElement('S') → …`, storage ended up
  holding the *default* `C`.

### 1.2 Themes were names without substance

* `theme_provider.dart` defined four `ThemeData` builders and **no persistence** — the
  choice was lost on every reload.
* The themes only reached `MaterialApp.theme`. Every painter and almost every screen
  hard-coded colours (`const Color(0xFF0F2027)`, `Colors.white`, `Colors.white54`),
  so the three non-default themes changed little more than a few Material widgets.
* The `scientificLight` theme was effectively broken: the dashboard, drawer and
  editor all painted white text on a light background.
* The theme dropdown read `ctx.read<ThemeNotifier>().currentTheme` inside a
  `showDialog` builder with **no listener**, so the dialog did not update when a theme
  was picked.
* No palette existed for the hand-written charts, so plot colours were hard-coded and
  identical on every background.

### 1.3 Avogadro integration was broken end to end

* **The plugin targeted a deprecated API.** `quantom_forge_export.py` used
  `--print-options` / `--run-command` and read from `stdin`. Avogadro 2.0 moved to
  static TOML metadata, passes the request JSON as the main argument, and no longer
  invokes `--run-command`. There was **no `avogadro.toml`/`pyproject.toml`**, and
  since Avogadro 1.103 a bare script is not installable at all — so the documented
  install path could not have produced a menu entry on any current release.
* **Wrong URL, and no way to change it.** The plugin opened
  `https://Quantum-forge.web.app` — wrong capitalisation and a typo'd host
  (`Quantum-forge` vs `quantom-forge`). It was hard-coded, so local development was
  impossible.
* **Padding was stripped from the base64 payload** (`encoded_xyz.rstrip('=')`), which
  makes the payload undecodable whenever the byte length is not a multiple of three.
  The reader then re-padded naively. This is exactly the "sometimes the export just
  doesn't work" class of bug.
* **Import failures were invisible.** `_checkForDeepLinkImport` wrapped everything in
  `try/catch` and reported failures only through `debugPrint`. A malformed payload
  produced no user-visible feedback whatsoever. The decoded `xyzString` was computed
  and then never used.
* **Imported structures went to the wrong place.** They were pushed into "first
  reactant" via `setManualFile`, which silently required the user to supply a second
  reactant and a product before anything could be dispatched — an imported molecule
  could not simply be looked at.
* **The URL was never cleaned**, so a refresh re-imported (and potentially re-ran) the
  same structure.
* **The exporter was mis-wired.** `main.dart` awaited the Firestore seed before
  `runApp` with a `print('Error during seeding: \$e')` — an escaped `$`, so the error
  text was the literal string `$e`.
* **The dashboard's export buttons did not export.**
  * "Export Results (.zip)" called `LocalStorageService.exportResultsToZip`, a stub
    returning the fake path `'memory://results_<id>.zip'`. The UI then reported
    "Exported to: memory://results_…zip" and downloaded nothing.
  * "Export for Avogadro (.xyz)" joined raw trajectory frames with `'\n'`, producing a
    file whose frame comments were blank and whose title lines did not identify the
    image.
  * `avogadro_export_web.dart` revoked the Blob URL immediately after `click()`,
    which can race the download in some browsers, and used `dart:js_interop`
    unconditionally, so the utility could not be compiled (or unit-tested) off web.
* **The editor had no Avogadro path at all** despite the README claiming
  "Seamless Avogadro 2 Integration" for the editor: no CJSON, no CML, no import of
  Avogadro's native format, and its 3D builder had no export button.
* `MoleculeParser._parseMol` / `_parseCml` duplicated and diverged from the XYZ
  parser's element tables, and the file picker did not accept `.cjson`.
* `mergeXyz` decoded file bytes with `String.fromCharCodes` (Latin-1) rather than
  UTF-8, corrupting any non-ASCII content.

### 1.4 Parser and rendering defects

* `XyzParser.parse` **ignored the declared atom count** and skipped two lines
  unconditionally. A multi-frame XYZ (exactly what a trajectory export is) was
  silently read as one molecule containing every frame's atoms concatenated. A
  two-atom molecule with a blank comment line returned nothing.
* The interactive builder hand-wrote its XYZ header while the painter used the live
  atom list, so the two could disagree.
* `interactive_builder_widget.dart` used `context.size!` during gesture handling;
  `context.size` is null before the first layout, so an early tap threw.
* The builder's hit-testing used a fixed `0.25` radius factor while the painter used
  a different one, so click targets drifted from what was drawn.
* `@Deprecated activeColor` on the editor's auto-optimise switch (Flutter 3.31+).
* Theme-unaware colours throughout (see 1.2).

### 1.5 Smaller issues

* `ElementData` had no symbol ⇄ atomic-number mapping, which CJSON and SDF writers
  need.
* The Formula builder in `xyz_parser.dart` wrote `C1H4`-style subscripts and omitted
  hydrogen for non-carbon compounds.
* `XyzParser` and the new interchange layer would have formed an import cycle.
* **The app could not be compiled for the Dart VM at all.** `web_bindings.dart`
  imported `dart:js_interop` unconditionally, and `LocalPrefs` (used by the compute
  settings) depended on it. Because the settings screen, quantum controls panel and
  chemical resolver all reached `web_bindings.dart`, no widget test could cover any
  of them — the import chain simply would not compile under `flutter test`. The
  whole web-services surface is now behind a conditional import.

## 2. What was changed

### 2.1 Settings

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/core/settings/app_settings_provider.dart` | Rebuilt: 18 persisted preferences across Appearance / Editor / Export / Avogadro; typed setters; range clamping; `flush()`; **ordered write chain fixing the lost-update race**; `resetToDefaults()` |
| `lib/main.dart` | `AppSettingsNotifier` now constructed **and registered**; `Consumer2` applies theme + density |
| `lib/features/settings/presentation/screens/settings_screen.dart` | **New** 5-tab settings screen with live export preview and platform install paths |
| `lib/features/reaction_runner/providers/settings_provider.dart` | All persistence keys unified into named constants; added `resetToDefaults()` |
| `lib/features/reaction_runner/presentation/widgets/dashboard_cards/left_nav_rail.dart` | Gear opens the real settings screen; theme switcher rebuilds live |

### 2.2 Themes

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/core/theme/quantum_theme.dart` | **New**: `QuantumTheme` with 25 semantic colour roles *plus* the plot palette, bond colours, atom style and VDW opacity; 7 presets, each documented against its scientific convention |
| `lib/core/theme/theme_provider.dart` | Persists the selection, `cycleTheme()`, `reset()`, `AppTheme.preset` |
| `lib/features/settings/.../settings_screen.dart` | Live theme cards with palette swatches and descriptions |
| Dashboard, drawer, editor, preview | Consume the palette instead of hard-coded colours |

### 2.3 Avogadro integration

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/core/utils/avogadro_interchange.dart` | **New**: CJSON / CML / SDF-V2000 / XYZ / multi-XYZ writers, bond perception with valence-aware order refinement, Hill formula |
| `lib/core/utils/avogadro_codec.dart` | **New**: reads CJSON, CML, XYZ (first frame only), SDF; base64url transport that restores stripped padding; 4 MB / 20 000-atom caps; every failure is a readable exception |
| `lib/core/utils/avogadro_deep_link.dart` | **New**: builds and parses `?import_struct=…` (CJSON) and the legacy `?import_xyz=…` |
| `lib/core/utils/avogadro_bridge{,_web,_stub}.dart` | **New**: platform-selected download / clipboard / `history.replaceState`; deferred Blob revoke fixes the download race; replaces the web-only `avogadro_export_web.dart` |
| `lib/features/reaction_runner/presentation/screens/coordinate_editor_screen.dart` | **Rewritten**: Avogadro action bar (Send to Avogadro / Export CJSON·CML·SDF·XYZ / Copy), structure title, format-agnostic import, honest error banner, theme + settings aware |
| `dashboard_screen.dart` | Deep-link handling rewritten (reports failures, honours prefs, cleans the URL, opens the **editor**); real `.zip` export via new `zip_writer.dart`; trajectory export writes a labelled multi-XYZ |
| `lib/core/utils/molecular.dart` | **New** shared model — breaks the parser/interchange import cycle |
| `lib/core/utils/zip_writer.dart` | **New**: spec-compliant ZIP (store method) with CRC-32 — the old export produced no file |
| `lib/core/services/web_services{,_web,_stub}.dart` | **New**: platform-selected fetch/openUrl/localStorage; replaces the unconditional `web_bindings.dart`, making the whole app VM-testable |
| `lib/core/utils/xyz_parser.dart` | Honours the declared atom count (frame-aware), added `serialize()`, delegates analysis to `molecular.dart` |
| `lib/core/utils/molecule_parser.dart` | Now a façade over `AvogadroCodec` (adds CJSON support) instead of a divergent duplicate |
| `lib/core/utils/element_data.dart` | Added `atomicNumber`, `symbolForAtomicNumber`, `canonicalSymbol` |
| `avogadro_plugin/quantum_forge_export.py` | **Rewritten for the Avogadro 2.0 API**: accepts the request JSON as argv *or* stdin, emits CJSON, keeps base64 padding, `QUANTUM_FORGE_URL` override, size guard, `--copy` / `--status` modes, and always answers with `message`/`error` JSON instead of crashing |
| `avogadro_plugin/avogadro.toml`, `pyproject.toml` | **New**: plugin metadata with three menu commands (required for any current Avogadro) |
| `avogadro_plugin/install_plugin.py` | **New**: cross-platform installer with `--dry-run` / `--force` / `--uninstall` |
| `avogadro_plugin/README.md` | Rewritten for the real API, layout and troubleshooting |

### 2.4 Rendering & robustness

* `interactive_builder_widget.dart`: canvas size captured in `LayoutBuilder`
  (no more `context.size!` crash), hit radius matches the painted radius, hydrogen
  hiding and bond drawing honoured, theme-aware bond/highlight/background colours,
  dead `_onScaleUpdate` removed and the pinch-zoom conflict documented.
* `main.dart`: Firestore seeding no longer blocks `runApp` and its broken `\$e`
  interpolation is gone; `Ctrl+Shift+T` cycles themes.
* `settings_provider.dart`: compute settings migrated off the web-only `LocalPrefs`
  onto `shared_preferences`, so the settings screen is unit-testable; added
  `flush()` and `resetToDefaults()`. `local_auth_service.dart` migrated the same
  way. (The `shared_preferences` half of this was later replaced — see §2.5.)
* `settings_screen.dart`: settings cards are `Material` (not `DecoratedBox`), so
  `ListTile` ink splashes are visible — a bug the widget tests caught.

### 2.5 Persistence: `shared_preferences` → `AppStorage`

**The defect.** In the deployed web build nothing persisted. `shared_preferences_web`
was in the lock file, but no registrant for it is generated into the web bundle, so
every call threw:

```
MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method getAll on channel
  plugins.flutter.io/shared_preferences)
```

Every provider caught that and fell back to its default, so the symptom was not a
crash but *"my settings reset every time I refresh"* — plus one exception per
provider in the console on every page load. Four call sites were affected: the
theme, `AppSettingsNotifier`, `QuantumSettingsNotifier`, `LocalAuthService` and
`SessionStateService`.

**Why not repair the registration.** `shared_preferences_web` is a thin wrapper
over the browser's `localStorage` anyway, so the package bought nothing here except
an async `getInstance()` that forced every notifier to load behind an `await` and
publish an "initialised" flag. The app already boots without Firebase and needs its
local state to survive that; the fewer moving parts in that path, the better.

**What replaced it.** `core/services/app_storage.dart`, a conditional export of
`app_storage_web.dart` (direct `localStorage`, with an automatic in-process
fallback when the page is sandboxed, third-party storage is blocked, or a write is
rejected for quota) and `app_storage_stub.dart` (an in-memory store for the VM and
non-web targets). The API is `getString/setString/getBool/setBool/getInt/setInt/
getDouble/setDouble/containsKey/remove/clear`, all synchronous, plus `isPersistent`
so a degraded page can say "session only" instead of silently losing writes.

Two details worth keeping:

* The stub is a **working** store, not a throwing one. "Settings survive a round
  trip through storage" is exactly what the settings and theme tests assert, and
  they can assert it against the stub; a throwing stub would have forced every one
  of them to mock persistence instead of exercising it.
* Values are one plain string per key rather than an opaque JSON blob, so they stay
  readable in the browser's storage inspector.

**Also fixed while here.** `core/services/local_storage_service.dart` (blob storage
for reaction artefacts, unrelated to settings) had a `dart.library.io` branch
pointing at `local_storage_service_io.dart`, which does not exist. The analyzer does
not verify that a conditional target exists, so it read as fine — but every
non-web compile failed with *"Error when reading '…_io.dart': The system cannot find
the file specified"*, which made this module and its importers (`main.dart`,
`ReactionNotifier`) impossible to unit-test on the VM and would have broken a
desktop build. The dead branch is gone and `test/local_storage_service_test.dart`
now imports the library so the mistake cannot return unnoticed.

`web_services_web.dart` also carried an unused second `localStorage` binding
(`getPref/setPref/removePref`) with no callers in either the web or stub
implementation; it was removed so there is exactly one storage path.

## 3. Verification

```
flutter analyze   →  0 issues
flutter test      →  276 tests pass
flutter build web →  succeeds
```

Test coverage added (11 new files):

| File | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `test/avogadro_interchange_test.dart` | Formula/element tables, bond perception, and all five writers incl. CJSON round-trip, V2000 column layout, XML escaping |
| `test/avogadro_deep_link_test.dart` | The exact payload the Python plugin emits, padding-residue handling, size/atom caps, legacy `import_xyz`, URL build → parse round-trip, multi-frame XYZ |
| `test/app_storage_test.dart` | The storage contract for every type: round trips, absent keys, wrong-typed text reading as `null` rather than throwing, overwrite/remove/clear, a JSON session payload, and that the VM stub reports `isPersistent == false` |
| `test/local_storage_service_test.dart` | That the conditional export in `local_storage_service.dart` resolves off the web (it did not compile before), and that the non-web stub fails loudly |
| `test/settings_and_theme_test.dart` | Defaults, `copyWith`/equality, endpoint resolution, format metadata, **persistence incl. the write-ordering regression**, clamping, all 7 themes' `ThemeData`, palette distinctness |
| `test/parsers_and_zip_test.dart` | XYZ header/frame handling, serialise round-trip, molecular analysis, ZIP structure and the known CRC-32 check value |
| `test/settings_screen_test.dart` | The full settings screen mounted with real providers: theme catalogue, theme switching + persistence, toggle write-through, export preview regeneration, Avogadro endpoint, compute settings, light-theme rendering and small-screen scrolling |
| `test/reaction_animation_test.dart` | The Avogadro-parity Player panel: upstream label strings, the 1-based `Frame: N/M` box, `Start:`/`End:` bounding, the `animate()` wrap in both directions, `Frame rate: 0` → 5 FPS, the full keyboard map, and that `Stop` really stops the ticker |
| `test/avogadro_geometry_test.dart` | The numbers behind Avogadro parity: the `element_color` palette (incl. carbon `#7F7F7F`, not Jmol's `#909090`), Alvarez/Pyykkö radii, the 0.45 Å bond tolerance and its exact boundaries, the H–H and noble-gas exclusions, and the sphere/cylinder radii for Ball and Stick, Licorice, Van der Waals and Wireframe |
| `test/results_summary_test.dart` | ΔG = ΔH − TΔS, Ea ≈ ΔH‡ + RT, the Eyring equation, the Arrhenius series, uncertainty propagation, significant-digit formatting and the literature-Ea accuracy metric |
| `test/results_ui_test.dart` | The full results surface (header, energy profile, hero metrics, Arrhenius, thermo grid) renders inside a scroll view without layout errors |

Persistence was then verified in a **real browser against the release build**, not
only on the VM, because "survives a refresh" is a claim about the browser:

```
$ flutter build web --release        # → build/web, copied to build/serve
$ node tool/serve.cjs                # static snapshot on 127.0.0.1:8202
$ node tool/persistence_check.cjs
  baseline (fresh profile)   : localStorage empty, 0 exceptions
  WRITE  type into the "Hugging Face API Token" field of the live UI
         → localStorage.qs_hf_token = "qf-persist-probe-token"   (22 qs_* keys written)
  RELOAD (Page.reload)
         → qs_hf_token still present, and the app rebuilt the field with it
  THEME  seed qf_theme_id = scientific_light, reload
         → near-white pixel fraction 0.0044 → 0.6842 (dark → light page)
  MissingPluginException occurrences: 0
  FAILURES: (none)
```

The theme step is deliberately a *different* provider and a different kind of
evidence: the rendered pixels change, so the restore is visible rather than merely
present in storage. `tool/persistence_check.cjs` addresses the canvas-rendered UI
through Flutter's semantics tree (assistive tech has to be switched on for Flutter
to build it), which yields real, addressable DOM elements for the click and the
keystroke; enabling it does not affect persistence.

Note the read of the restored text field: Flutter mirrors the editing value into
that semantic element only while it is the active edit target, so the probe clicks
the field before reading it — which is also the honest check, since it is what a
user would see in it. An unfocused read returns `""` even when the field holds text.

The plugin was additionally exercised end to end from the shell:

```
$ echo '{"cjson":{...water...}}' | QUANTUM_FORGE_NO_BROWSER=1 python quantum_forge_export.py
https://quantom-forge.web.app/?import_struct=eyJjaGVtaWNhbEpzb24i…%3D%3D&fmt=cjson&source=avogadro&name=Water
{"message": "Opened Quantum Forge (https://quantom-forge.web.app) with 3 atoms."}
```

and the emitted URL is decoded by `avogadro_deep_link_test.dart`, so both sides of
the bridge are pinned by the same fixture.

## 3.1 Value accuracy & uncertainty (follow-up)

**Accuracy finding.** Every thermodynamic/kinetic value the dashboard showed was
derived from hard-coded "typical" constants — a 25.4 kcal/mol barrier, −12.3
cal/mol·K activation entropy, a 5.2 eV gap, a 45.2 Bohr³ polarisability, etc. —
and `reaction_provider.dart` fabricates the trajectory and energy profile locally
("Generate mock energy profile" / a Gaussian bell curve). There is **no quantum
chemistry engine** behind the numbers, so they are *not* physically accurate for
the actual molecule; they are surrogate placeholders.

The *relationships*, however, were already correct: ΔG = ΔH − T·ΔS, the Eyring
equation, Ea ≈ ΔH‡ + RT, and the Arrhenius slope. Those are now preserved and
unit-tested.

**Remediation (this round).**

* Centralised the computation in `results_summary.dart` with a
  `MetricEstimate` type that carries a 1σ uncertainty, a quality tier
  (`computed / surrogate / empirical / illustrative`) and a method string.
* Attached documented, order-of-magnitude uncertainties (MLIP-vs-DFT levels):
  ±1.6 kcal/mol on ΔG‡/Ea, ±2 cal/mol·K on ΔS‡, ±0.3 D on the dipole, ±0.3 eV on
  the gap, ±10% on the imaginary frequency, and log-space error on the rate
  constant (σ_log10 ≈ 1.2, propagated from ΔG‡ through the Eyring equation).
* Significant digits now follow the uncertainty — a ±2 kcal/mol barrier is never
  printed as "12.34 kcal/mol".
* Every value is displayed as `value ± err` with a colour-coded quality badge and
  its method, and the whole report opens with a **methods header** (model,
  solvent, temperature, confidence, and an "estimates only, not for publication"
  disclaimer).
* The energy profile and Arrhenius plot now draw ±1σ **error bands**.
* A real **accuracy metric** appears when the reaction came from a template with
  a literature Ea: the signed error and percentage vs. the reference.

The honest position is stated in the UI itself: these are *surrogate estimates*,
which is the correct thing to show until a real engine (e.g. XTB/DFT) is wired in.

---

## 4. Known limitations (deliberate)

* **ZIP uses the store method** (no deflate). Trajectories are text and compress
  well, but shipping a compression implementation was not worth the risk for a
  handful of files. Archives are valid and open everywhere.
* **Large structures cannot travel by deep link.** Browsers truncate very long URLs;
  past ~60 kB the plugin and the editor both refuse and tell the user to export a
  file instead. A POST-to-localhost transport was considered but requires a running
  local service, which contradicts a browser-only app.
* **`avogadro.toml` schema is inferred** from the Avogadro 2.0 documentation, whose
  reference examples are not currently published. `avogadro.toml` + `pyproject.toml`
  are both shipped, and the plugin answers every documented flag, so it degrades
  gracefully if the exact table names differ.
* **Theme coverage is broad but not total.** The dashboard, drawer, editor and
  settings screens are theme-driven; a few older result cards still use fixed
  accents for metric chips, which read acceptably on all seven backgrounds.
* **The web fetch wrapper is a thin browser shim**, not a port of the chemical
  resolver to a cross-platform HTTP client. `WebServices.fetchString` throws
  `UnsupportedError` off the web, which is correct for a web-only app but means the
  resolver itself is not exercised by VM tests; the resolver's parsing logic is
  tested indirectly through the rest of the suite.
* **Persistence is durable on the web only.** `AppStorage` keeps state in the
  browser's `localStorage`, which is what the deployed app runs on. On a desktop or
  mobile build the conditional export selects the in-memory stub, so settings
  survive navigation within a session but not a restart — `isPersistent` reports
  that honestly rather than implying otherwise. A `dart:io`/`path_provider` variant
  is the obvious next step if desktop becomes a target; it was not written because
  it could not be verified here (no desktop toolchain, and the shipped target is
  Flutter Web). This is strictly better than the state it replaced, where writes
  failed on *every* platform with `MissingPluginException`.
